<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<div id="contacts_empty" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why is my contact list empty?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Threema only shows those contacts that have already installed Threema. The list
			is updated about every 24 hours; therefore it can take a while before new Threema users
			appear on your list.</p>
		
		<p>You can force an immediate update by pulling down and releasing the contact list.</p>1
			
		<p>If a person doesn't appear even though you know that they have installed Threema, it's
			usually because the information in your system address book doesn't match the e-mail
			address or phone number that they have linked to their Threema ID.</p>
		
		<p>For the synchronization to work, it needs to be enabled in Threema (Settings &gt; Privacy),
			and on iOS Threema also needs access to the contacts (iPhone Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Contacts &gt; enable Threema).</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="nosms" class="faqitem">
	<h3>I didn't receive my verification email or SMS!</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Emails may get stuck in spam filters, so please check your spam folder, and please
		   be patient. Some ISPs use greylisting, which causes emails from new senders to be
		   delayed by up to an hour.</p>
		
		<p>You can try again (possibly using a different e-mail address) by going back into
		   the "Linked Email" dialog, clearing the address, and saving. This will reset the status
		   and you will be able to try again.</p>
		
		<p>SMS: while we make a best effort to deliver verification text messages to all countries, unfortunately
		   sometimes messages get lost. This can be temporary, or caused by filtering of messages
		   from other countries by your carrier. Threema offers you the option to receive the code
		   via a phone call. On iOS, simply go back into the "Linked number" dialog and choose the call option.
		   On Android, a button to trigger a phone call will appear automatically after the SMS reception timeout
		   has elapsed (approx. one minute).
		   Please note that we cannot call certain countries/numbers.</p>

<div id="nopush" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why am I not receiving any push notifications or experiencing delays?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>iOS:</strong></p>
				
				<p>Please perform the following steps to troubleshoot push notifications on iOS:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Go to iPhone Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Threema. Ensure that badges, alerts and sounds are turned on.</li>
					<li>Turn off your phone.</li>
					<li>Turn your phone back on.</li>
					<li>Launch Threema so it can re-negotiate push notifications with the server.</li>
					<li>Push notifications should now be working.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Also make sure you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network that blocks the ports that Apple
					uses for push notifications (try turning off Wi-Fi to see if this makes push notifications work).</p>

				<p>If you still cannot receive push notifications even after following the steps above, try deleting and reinstalling
					the app from the App Store as a last resort (you will not be charged again). By reinstalling, the so-called push token that the
					iOS system generates for the app is recreated. Your Threema ID will be retained, but the contacts and any saved messages in the app will be lost
					(don't forget to re-enable contact synchronization in Settings &gt; Privacy after reinstallation if desired).</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p><strong>Android:</strong></p>
				
				<p>Threema uses Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) so that it does not have to stay connected to the Threema server in the background all the time (which would
					cause additional battery drain). After one minute in the background, the connection to the Threema server is disconnected, and the server informs the app
					via GCM when new messages arrive.</p>
				
				<p>If notifications about new messages are often delayed or do not arrive at all (i.e. you only receive them when you open the app manually), you
					can try the following:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that your Internet access allows TCP ports 5228-5230 for GCM (firewall etc.).</li>
					<li>Reboot your phone.</li>
					<li>Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Threema and check that "Show notifications" is enabled.</li>
					<li>Go to Settings &gt; Data usage, press the menu button and ensure that "Restrict background data" is disabled.</li>
					<li>Start the Google Hangouts app, press the menu button, choose "Settings" and then "Sign out". Then start the Hangouts app again.</li>
					<li>Reset the push token in Threema (Settings &gt; Troubleshooting).</li>
					<li>Go to Settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Advanced and ensure that "Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep" is set to "Always". Alternatively, you can also try the setting "Never".</li>
					<li>Uninstall all task killer apps.</li>
					<li>If you have a software firewall installed on your phone, deactivate it to see if it interferes with the push connection.</li>
					<li>If the above steps do not help: enable polling in Threema (Settings &gt; Troubleshooting).</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Delays due to NAT/firewall timeouts (can also affect 3G depending on the provider) can be fixed using the
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andqlimax.pushfixer">Push Notification Fixer</a> (rooted phones only).</p>

<div id="no_sync_after_reboot" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why does the synchronisation not work anymore after rebooting my phone?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p><strong>This problem only affects the Android version of Threema under specific versions of the Android operating system.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Some Android versions (Jelly Bean 4.1.1 ist usually affected, and on some Samsung devices even more recent versions) have a bug that affects paid apps. The sync account is lost
			after rebooting the phone; consequently, the contact synchronization does not work anymore. We're currently searching for a
			reasonable workaround and recommend all users to update to a newer operating system version if possible.</p>
		
		<p>As a temporary solution, you can turn the synchronization off and on again in the Threema settings. This will cause the account
			to be recreated and the synchronization will work again until the next phone reboot.</p>
			
		<p>More information on this Android bug can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34880">here</a>.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="lost_pass" class="faqitem">
	<h3>I forgot my PIN/passphrase/lock code. What can I do now?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Lost passphrases or lock codes cannot be recovered. However, you can reset the app and then set
			it up again. You will lose all saved messages and your ID (unless you have a backup).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Android:</strong> delete the app data by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Threema &gt; Clear data.</p>
		
		<p><strong>iOS:</strong> enter a wrong code 10 times. A button will appear in the upper left-hand corner
			that allows you to reset the app data.</p>

<div id="levels_expl" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What do the verification levels (dots) mean?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<ul>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/verification_red.png" width="49" height="11" style="margin-right: 10px" alt="Level 1"><strong>Level 1</strong> (red): the ID and public key have been
            obtained from the server because you received a message
            from this contact for the first time. No matching contact
            was found in your address book (by phone number or
            e-mail), and therefore you cannot be sure that the person
            is who they claim to be in their messages.</li>
			
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/verification_orange.png" width="49" height="11" style="margin-right: 10px" alt="Level 2"><strong>Level 2</strong> (orange): the ID has been matched with a
            contact in your address book (by phone number or e-mail).
            Since the server verifies phone numbers and e-mail
            addresses, you can be reasonably sure that the person is
            who they claim to be.</li>
			
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/verification_green.png" width="49" height="11" style="margin-right: 10px" alt="Level 3"><strong>Level 3</strong> (green): you have personally verified the
            ID and public key of the person by scanning their 2D
            code. Assuming their device has not been hijacked, you can
            be very sure that messages from this contact were really
            written by the person that they indicate.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The verification levels don't change anything in the encryption strength (it is always
			the same high-grade ECC based encryption), but they are a measure of the
			trust that the public keys saved for your contacts really belong to them. Having the
			wrong public keys leaves you open to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, therefore it is
			important to verify the keys.</p>
	</div>
</div>


<div id="connstripe_expl" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What does the color stripe mean?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>The color stripe (below the navigation bar) shows the connection status at a glance.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Red: Threema is currently not connected to the server. This is usually due to
				problems with the Internet connectivity of your phone (e.g. when you have no 3G
				reception, or are connected to a broken Wi-Fi network or to a Wi-Fi hotspot
				that requires login). Threema will keep trying every 10 seconds.</li>
			<li>Orange: Threema is connecting to the server. A response has been received (so
				the connection is working), but the login process has not completed yet. If this
				appears for more than a few seconds, it's usually due to a very bad (slow, lossy)
				Internet connection.</li>
			<li>Green: Threema is connected to the server. New messages will appear almost immediately.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>


<div id="status_expl" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What do the message status symbols mean?</h3>

				The message is being sent to the server. If this status appears for more than a few seconds,
				there may be connection problems. The message will stay in the queue and will be sent
				as soon as the connection is up (iOS: only when the app is open).</li>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/MessageStatus_sent.png" alt="message sent" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: -3px" width="20" height="18"> <strong>Message sent</strong><br>
				The message has been sent to the server and is awaiting delivery to the recipient. A push
				notification has also been sent if necessary.</li>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/MessageStatus_delivered.png" alt="message delivered" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: -3px" width="20" height="18"> <strong>Message delivered</strong><br>
				The message has been received by the recipient's device, but has not yet been read (i.e. not
				fully displayed on the screen because the user is in another conversation or menu), or the recipient has turned off read receipts.
				For technical resons, iOS recipients will only indicate this status after they have opened the app
				(and not already when the push notification is shown), and only if they have enabled read receipts.</li>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/MessageStatus_read.png" alt="message read" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: -3px" width="20" height="18"> <strong>Message read</strong><br>
				The message has been read by the recipient. Note that if the recipient has disabled read receipts,
				you will not see this status.</li>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/MessageStatus_sendfailed.png" alt="send failed" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: -3px" width="20" height="18"> <strong>Send failed</strong><br>
				The message could not be sent. This can happen for example when an image upload is interrupted.
				You can long-tap the message and choose “Try again” (iOS), or “Forward” and then the same recipient (Android).</li>
			<li><img src="./Threema - Seriously secure mobile messaging_files/MessageStatus_userack.png" alt="user acknowledgement" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: -3px" width="20" height="18"> <strong>User acknowledgment</strong><br>
				The recipient has manually acknowledged the message (by long-tapping it and choosing “Acknowledge”),
				implying that he/she has read and understood it and agrees to the contents.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>


<div id="profilepic" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Where can I set my profile picture?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">		
		<p>Threema does not store any profile pictures, so there is no way to change the picture
		   that appears to other users (as you may be used to from other messengers).
		   When another user adds you to their contact list and links your ID to an address book
		   entry, Threema automatically uses the contact photo from their address book. Note
		   that IDs and address book entries are linked automatically when synchronizing contacts.</p>
		
		<p>In the Android version, you can change the picture that is shown to you for your own
			messages in the chat by changing the "Me" contact in the "People/Contacts" app.</p>
	</div>
</div>


<div id="emojis" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How can I send smilies/emoticons?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>iOS:</strong> Unicode emoticons are handled by the system. Go to Settings &gt;
				General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboards and activate the "Emoji" keyboard. After that, you can
				switch to this keyboard while you're typing by tapping the globe symbol.</li>
				
			<li><strong>Android:</strong> emoji menu next to the
				input field. Incoming messages with common Unicode emojis will automatically be displayed
				correctly (independent of installed system fonts). Third party emoji keyboards are not necessary.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="newphone" class="faqitem">
	<h3>I've got a new phone — how do I move my ID/messages/contacts?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>ID:</strong> You can create a backup of your ID within the app, and we highly recommend that
				   you do so even if you don't plan on buying a new phone, as otherwise your ID
				   will be lost forever if you lose your phone or if it gets damaged.</p>
		
				<p>Simply go to the “My ID” tab in the app, scroll down, select “Backup” and
				   choose a password. The private ID data (i.e. your private key) will be
				   encrypted and displayed in text format and as a QR code. You can then copy &amp; paste the backup text to a safe
				   location, or scan the QR code using the new phone.</p>
		
				<p>Note that if you perform the backup multiple times, the output will look different
				   each time; that is because some random data is used in the password hashing process.</p>
		
				<p>To restore, tap the “Restore” button on the screen where it prompts you to move
				   your finger to generate random data.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p><strong>Messages/Contacts:</strong> the procedure to follow depends on whether you're using the iOS or Android version.
					
					</p><ul>
						<li><strong>iOS:</strong> messages and contacts are included in the iTunes/iCloud backup. If you restore your new phone
							from a backup of the old phone, you will keep all messages and contacts. Important: the ID needs to be backed up 
							separately (see above).</li>
						
						<li><strong>Android:</strong> messages and contacts can be saved using the “Backup Data” option at the bottom of the “My ID” tab.
							A password protected ZIP file will be created in the path Threema/Backups; you can copy this file to the new device (in the same path).
							The restore process can be started using the “Restore”
							button on the initial setup screen (where it prompts you to move
							   your finger to generate random data).</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
				
				<p>Messages and contacts cannot be moved across platforms (iOS/Android).</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

</div>

<div id="chatexport" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How can I export my chat history?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>iOS:</strong> use the "Email Conversation" button in contact details to send the chat history as a text file via email
				(e.g. to your own address). Group chats can be exported in the chat details (scroll to the top of the chat and tap "Info").</li>
				
			<li><strong>Android:</strong> long-tap a conversation in the list and then tap the "Share" button. You will be able to choose from
				the installed apps to save or send the chat history in text format.</li>

<div id="group_adddel" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Can members be added or deleted from an existing group?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>No – members cannot be added to or removed from an existing group
			(any group participant can leave the group by deleting it on his device though). To add more members,
			a new group must be created.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="group_whygray" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why are some contacts grayed out when choosing group members?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">

<div class="faqsection">
	
<h2>Android specific</h2>

<div id="android_version" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Which Android version is required?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Threema runs on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and up. At this time, there are no plans for compatibility
			with earlier Android versions. The effort required is too high, especially given the slowly but steadily dwindling
			user base on earlier versions, and the fact that we don't want to compromise usability for users with 4.0+.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_permissions" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Which permissions are used under Android, and for what purpose?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Here is an explanation of the most important permissions that Threema for Android requires:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Read/write contacts</strong><br>
				Required for address book synchronization. If the synchronization is off,
				contact data is not accessed.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Receive text messages</strong><br>
				Used for mobile phone number linking (to automatically receive the verification SMS
				and extract the code) and only active while the status bar for the phone number linking
				is being displayed.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Location</strong><br>
				Used for the "Send location" feature.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Accounts</strong><br>
				Used for contact synchronization resp. integration into the account management of Android.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Storage</strong><br>
				Used for saving media data (photos, videos).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_unlocked" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What does the message "Master key is unlocked" mean?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>This notification is shown if you're using the Android version of Threema and have set a passphrase
			on your master key. In order to prevent the operating system from terminating the Threema process
			(which would cause the unlocked master key to be lost as it is only held in RAM, necessitating manual re-entry of the passphrase),
			the app needs to show a notification. This notification has no other purpose and is only required
			because of the aforementioned limitation of Android.</p>
		
		<p>Please note: in times of extreme memory shortage, Android will even terminate processes that show a 
			persistent notification. In that case, it is possible that you are prompted for the master key passphrase again.
			This is caused by Android; Threema has no influence on this process termination.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_howtolock" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Where do I find the master key lock button?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>In version 1.2, a new PIN lock feature has been introduced (can be enabled in settings),
			which is much better suited to use as a user interface lock, and easier to use than the
			master key passphrase. The master key passphrase is therefore now only intended as protection
			against offline attacks, for which a one-time prompt after a device reboot is sufficient.</p>

		<p>If you set up a PIN, the lock button will reappear in the action bar and can be used for manually activating the PIN lock.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_smscode" class="faqitem">
	<h3>I have received an SMS with my code – where do I enter it?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>On Android, Threema normally receives and processes the SMS with the code automatically.
			If you get an SMS with a link (which is designed for iOS users) and code for manual entry,
			that is usually due to an alternative SMS app like e.g. GoSMS that catches the SMS before Threema can process it.</p>
		
		<p>You can enter the code that you received manually by tapping on the keypad icon next to "Mobile number" on the
			third tab in Threema.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_delays" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why are incoming messages sometimes delayed, or only arrive if I open the app manually?</h3>
		
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>This is usually caused by problems with push notifications. Please see the answer to
			"<a href="https://threema.ch/en/faq.html#nopush">Why am I not receiving any push notifications?</a>" above.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_delcontact" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How do I delete a contact?</h3>
		
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Go to the detail view of the contact that you want to delete, and then tap the trash icon
			(or, depending on the model, choose "Delete" from the menu).</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_delchat" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How do I delete a chat?</h3>
		
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Simply long-tap the desired chat in the list of chats, and then choose "Delete" (or the
			trash icon, depending on screen size).</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_save_picture" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How do I save received photos/videos?</h3>
		
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Long-tap the desired photo/video in the chat, and then choose "Save" (floppy disk icon). The saved photo/video can be found in
			the directory "Threema/Threema Pictures" (or "Threema Videos"). </p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="android_contact_photo" class="faqitem">
	<h3>How can I assign a photo to a contact?</h3>
		
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Threema reads contact photos from the device's contact store. If you assign a photo to a contact in the "People/Contacts" app,
			this photo will automatically be used by Threema (on some devices, a reboot may be required for this to happen).</p>
			
		<p>For Threema contacts that could not be automatically connected to an address book entry – e.g. because the respective
			person has not linked their Threema ID with a phone number or email address – this connection can be made manually
			through the "People/Contacts" app (menu item "Merge contacts").</p>

	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>If the contact has been synchronized with the device's address book, simply change the name in the "People/Contacts" app.
			After the next synchronization in Threema (can be forced by pulling down and releasing the contact list), the new

<h2>Security</h2>

<div id="why_secure" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What makes Threema secure?</h3>

	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Threema uses state-of-the-art asymmetric cryptography<sup>1</sup> to protect
		messages between sender and receiver, as well as the communication between
		the app and the servers.</p>
		
		<p>There are two layers of encryption: the end-to-end layer between the
			conversation participants, and an additional layer to protect against
			eavesdropping of the connection between the app and the servers. The latter
			is necessary to ensure that an adversary who captures network packets (e.g. on a public
			wireless network) cannot even learn who is logging in and sending a message to whom.</p>
		
		<p>All message encryption and decryption happens directly on the device,
			and the user has control over the key exchange. This guarantees that no
			third party — not even the server operators — can decrypt the content
			of the messages.</p>
			
		<p>There is a validation log feature in the app that can be used for independent
			verification of the end-to-end encryption. See <a href="https://threema.ch/validation">here</a>
			for details.</p>

		<p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Specifically, it uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with the <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl
		Cryptography Library</a>. The advantages of ECC over traditional RSA include higher performance and smaller message sizes.
			For more information on the encryption algorithms used in Threema, see
			<a href="http://cr.yp.to/highspeed/naclcrypto-20090310.pdf">Cryptography in NaCl</a>.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="crypto_strength" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What is the strength of the encryption?</h3>

	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>The asymmetric ECC based encryption used by Threema has a strength of 255 bits. According
		to a <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57_part1_rev3_general.pdf">NIST estimate</a>
		(page 64), this corresponds at least with the strength provided by 2048
		bit RSA. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDH">ECDH</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519">Curve25519</a> is used in conjunction with a hash function and a random nonce to derive a unique 256 bit symmetric key for each
		message, and the stream cipher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">XSalsa20</a> is then used to encrypt the
		message. A 128 bit message authentication code (MAC) is also added to each message
			to detect manipulations/forgeries.</p>
		
		<p>For more information on the encryption algorithms used in Threema, see
			<a href="http://cr.yp.to/highspeed/naclcrypto-20090310.pdf">Cryptography in NaCl</a>.</p>

		<p>Threema adds a random amount of padding to each message to thwart
        attempts to guess the content of a message by looking at the amount of
        data (note that image messages are of course still several orders of
        magnitude larger than text messages).</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="crypto_authorities" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Could you decrypt my messages, for example if you were required to by law enforcement?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>No, that is impossible, as we don't have the secret keys of
		our users (your secret key never leaves your device). Our servers do
		need to know who is sending a message to whom, so that they can route
		it to the correct recipient, but they do not log this information, and
		cannot decrypt the message's content.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="crypto_differences" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What separates Threema from other messengers with encryption?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Many manufacturers of messengers claim that their product encrypts the messages that users exchange. However, with most of them the server operator
			can still read the content of the messages due to the following reasons:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Transport encryption only:</strong> usually only the connection between the mobile device
				and the server is encrypted, e.g. using SSL. While this means that messages cannot be intercepted
				while in transit over the network (a common problem in public wireless LAN hotspots), they are in 
				unencrypted form again once they reach the server.<br>
				<span class="gray bold">Common examples: SMS, WhatsApp<sup>®</sup></span></li>
			
			<li><strong>End-to-end encryption without key verification by user:</strong> in this case, the manufacturer
				claims that there is end-to-end encryption, but due to missing user interface functions, the user has no
				way to verify that another contact's public key really matches with the private key that is only known
				to that contact. Therefore it is easy for the operator to perform a MITM attack by manipulating the
				automatic key exchange without this being noticed. Subsequently, he's able to decrypt and even forge exchanged messages.<br>
				<span class="gray bold">Common example: iMessage<sup>®</sup></span></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Threema uses end-to-end encryption and enables users to verify the public keys of their conversation partners offline.
		   Of course there is also a separate transport encryption layer to protect the header information 
		   (= to whom should the message be delivered) in transit over the Internet.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="crypto_mitm" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Is Threema secure against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Nobody can spoof a message that appears to come from
        somebody else's ID. However, anyone can send you a
        message and claim to be somebody else in writing, so you need
        to verify through a secure channel (preferrably in person)
        that the ID of the person you are communicating with is
        really theirs.</p>
		
		<p>If you are sure about your chat partner's ID, then
        there's no way for an attacker to spoof or intercept/decrypt a
        message from or to your chat partner.</p>
		
		<p>The connection between the app and the servers is secure
        against MITM attacks because the server authenticates itself
        to the app based on a public key that is hard-coded into the
        app and whose corresponding secret key is only known by the
        legitimate servers.</p>
		
		<p>Please note: Threema can only be as secure as the device that it is running on.
			Malware that runs in the background on your device can intercept and falsify data
			without being noticed.
			We highly recommend to always install the most recent operating system updates
			and to only use software from trusted sources.</p>

<div id="crypto_pfs" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Does Threema provide forward secrecy?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Threema provides forward secrecy on the network
        connection (not on the end-to-end layer). Client and server negotiate temporary random keys,
        which are only stored in RAM and replaced every time the app restarts
		(and at least once every 7 days). An attacker who has captured
        the network traffic will not be able to decrypt it even if he
        finds out the long-term secret key of the client or the server
        after the fact.</p>
	</div>
</div>


<div id="crypto_local" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Are messages encrypted when they are stored on my device?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Yes.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>iOS:</strong> Threema uses the iOS Data Protection feature (with NSFileProtectionComplete) to encrypt messages,
					images etc. in the device's flash storage. The key used for this encryption
					is linked to the device PIN and is only available while the device is unlocked.
					It is necessary to set a PIN in the system settings to use this feature.
					On newer models, iOS also uses hardware features for the encryption; therefore
					even a simple four-digit PIN offers a certain protection. For the highest
					protection against brute force attacks, you should choose a longer, more
					complex passcode.</p>

				<p>Note: the passcode lock that is built into the app itself does not offer any
					additional encryption. This feature is intended to keep nosy people from reading
					your messages when you intentionally give them your phone for a short time 
					for another purpose. Encryption with a four digit PIN inside the app would not
					be sensible, as brute force attacks would be trivial (since unlike iOS, an app
					cannot access special hardware features to protect the key).</p>
			</li>
				
			<li>
				<p><strong>Android:</strong> Threema includes its own app-specific encryption based on AES-256 to protect
				stored messages, media and your ID's private key. The key used for this encryption is
				generated randomly the first time you start Threema, and can optionally be protected by
				setting a Master Key Passphrase in the settings, which we highly recommend. Without
				a passphrase, the encryption will only add obscurity due to the way hardware encryption
				is handled on Android. If you set a Master Key Passphrase, you will have to enter it
				after every restart of the device (and after the system has terminated the app due
				to low memory).
				
				</p><p>Note: the PIN lock, which can be enabled independently of the master key passphrase,
					does not cause any additional encryption; it is simply a UI lock.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		
	</div>
</div>


<div id="addressbook_data" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Will my address book data be sent to your servers?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>That is your decision – Threema can be used without any address book access. If you have disabled the synchronization
			in Threema, no address book data will be read. You will then have to manually add your Threema contacts
			(by typing in their IDs or scanning QR codes).</p>
		
		<p>If you decide to use the synchronization, email addresses and phone numbers from your address book will
			only be transmitted to the server in one-way encrypted ("hashed") form and additionally protected using SSL. The servers only keep these hashes
			in volatile memory for a short time to determine the list of matching IDs, and then delete the hashes immediately.
			At no point are the hashes or the results of the synchronization written to disk.
		</p>
		
		<p class="footnote">Please note: due to the relatively low number of possible phone number combinations, it is theoretically possible to
			crack hashes of phone numbers by trying all possibilities. This is due to the nature of hashes and phone numbers and cannot be solved
			differently (using salts like for hashing passwords does not work for this kind of data matching). Therefore we treat phone number hashes
			with the same care as if they were raw/unhashed phone numbers.</p>

<div id="multidevice" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Can I install Threema on multiple devices?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>At this time only one device per ID is supported. While it is possible to transfer

	</div>
</div>

<div id="desktopversion" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Will there be a desktop version?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer">
		<p>Desktop versions of Threema (e.g. for Windows or Mac OS X) are on the long-term plan. For these to

		<p>At this time, no specific date is known.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="threema_id_expl" class="faqitem">
	<h3>What is a Threema ID?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>A Threema ID consists of 8 characters (uppercase
        letters and digits) and is permanently tied to a user's public
        key. It is assigned randomly by a Threema server when your
        device submits its new public key for the first time.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="push_preview" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why can't I see a preview of the message in Push Notifications?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>On iOS, Push Notifications cannot be processed by an
        application that is in the background - they are displayed by
        the system the way that the server sent them, and the
        application is only informed about it when you launch it. When
        the server generates a Push Notification, it cannot decrypt
        the message text (as it does not have the key), and the
        application on your device (that would have the key) doesn't
        get a chance to do it either. Therefore, there is no message
        preview. Think of it as a security advantage.
		Update iOS 7: here it is possible in priciple to act on
		push messages in the background; however the protection level
		of the private key in the keychain, as well as the iOS Data Protection
		on the message database, would have to be weakened – therefore this
		probably won't be implemented.</p>

		<p>On Android, Threema can decrypt new incoming messages in the
			background and thus present them with a preview in the
			notification bar.</p>

<div id="name_origin" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why is it called Threema?</h3>
	
	<div class="faqanswer" style="display: block;">
		<p>Threema started life as an abbreviation: EEEMA, for

<div id="why_not_otr" class="faqitem">
	<h3>Why didn't you just use OTR?</h3>

		<p>Please perform the following steps to keep your old ID from appearing in the contact list of 
			your chat partners:</p>
			
		<ol>
			<li>Link your new ID with the same email address and phone number as your old ID. This will cause
				the link of the old ID to be removed, since every email address or phone number can only be
				linked to one ID at a time.</li>
			
			<li>Ask your chat partners to delete your old ID from their contact list. It will not be found during
